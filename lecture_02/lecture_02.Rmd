# Monte Carlo Methods Applied to Chemical Systems {#monte-carlo-chemical}

## Introduction to Non-Uniform Sampling

The previous lecture introduced the general idea behind Monte Carlo methods: using repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results.
In the first lecture, we focussed on the problem of calculating some property $A$ as an average over a large set of states.

Recall from the first lecture that for any property A, its true average value is calculated as a sum over all possible states:

$$
\langle A \rangle = \sum_i A_i \times P_i
$$

Where $A_i$ is the value of property A in state $i$, and $P_i$ is the probability of state $i$ occurring. In many problems of this type, evaluating this sum exactly is impossible due to the existence of an enormous number of states.
Monte Carlo methods allow us to estimate $\langle A \rangle$ by sampling a subset of randomly chosen states.

In the examples in Lecture \@ref(monte-carlo-introduction), we used uniform sampling&mdash;where each possible location in our sample space has an equal probability of being selected. In these examples, uniform sampling was effective because it allowed us to efficiently explore the regions of sample space relevant to the property we were estimating.

For chemical systems at equilibrium, however, uniform sampling is highly inefficient, frequently to the extent of being computationally intractable, and we instead use non-uniform sampling to more efficiently estimate $\langle A \rangle$.

## Boltzmann Sampling and the Inefficiency of Uniform Sampling

For chemical systems at equilibrium, states are distributed according to the Boltzmann distribution:

$$
P(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{\exp(-U(\mathbf{r})/kT)}{Z}
$$

Where the partition function $Z$ is:

$$
Z = \sum \exp(-U(\mathbf{r})/kT)
$$

If we were to sample uniformly, we might initially propose estimating $\langle A \rangle$ via:

$$
\langle A \rangle \approx \frac{1}{Z} \sum_{i=1}^N A(r_i) \exp(-U(r_i)/kT)
$$

However, this approach requires knowing $Z$, which we typically cannot compute directly as it involves summing over all possible states—the very challenge we're using Monte Carlo to overcome.

Fortunately, we can construct an alternative estimator that doesn't require prior knowledge of $Z$:

$$
\langle A \rangle \approx \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N A(r_i) \exp(-U(r_i)/kT)}{\sum_{i=1}^N \exp(-U(r_i)/kT)}
$$

The denominator effectively estimates $Z$ from our samples, allowing us to compute averages without knowing $Z$ in advance.

Even with this improved estimator, uniform sampling remains highly inefficient for chemical systems. The Boltzmann factor decreases exponentially as energy increases, meaning any property $\langle A \rangle$ is dominated by contributions from a relatively small number of low-energy states. The vast majority of possible states have high energies with negligible Boltzmann weights, yet these states occupy most of the configuration space.

Consider a molecular system with $N$ atoms ($3N$ spatial degrees of freedom). In a system with just 10 atoms, uniform sampling would predominantly generate configurations with atoms positioned unphysically close to each other. These high-energy configurations have effectively zero Boltzmann weights, contributing nothing to our estimate of $\langle A \rangle$. However, uniform sampling spends nearly all of its time generating these irrelevant states, resulting in extremely slow convergence.

This inefficiency worsens exponentially with system size. Each additional degree of freedom further reduces the already tiny fraction of configuration space containing physically relevant states. For most chemical systems of interest, uniform sampling becomes computationally unfeasible.

We need an alternative approach—a method that preferentially samples the low-energy regions that dominate the Boltzmann distribution. This is the central focus of this lecture.

## The Solution: Markov Chain Monte Carlo

In Lecture \@ref(monte-carlo-introduction), we discussed estimating the average height of people in Britain by measuring a representative sample. Let's revisit this example to illustrate the challenge of sampling from a complex distribution.

If we attempted uniform geographical sampling—randomly selecting 100m × 100m squares on a map of Britain and measuring everyone within each selected square—we would encounter severe inefficiency. Most selected squares would contain few or no people (falling on rural areas, forests, mountains, or bodies of water), while densely populated urban areas would be underrepresented. We would waste most of our sampling effort on empty regions while gathering insufficient data from cities and towns, where the majority of people live.

This mirrors our problem in chemical systems: uniform sampling of configuration space predominantly generates high-energy states with negligible Boltzmann weights, while the physically relevant low-energy states occupy only a tiny fraction of the total space.

A more efficient approach to our height-measuring problem would be to design a sampling process that naturally visits locations with frequency proportional to their population density. Imagine a "random walker" traversing the UK, who:

1. Spends most time in cities and towns
2. Occasionally visits villages and small settlements
3. Rarely ventures into uninhabited areas

This walker would measure the height of individuals encountered during the journey. The crucial insight is that if our walker visits each location with probability *exactly proportional* to the number of people there, then each person in the UK has an equal chance of being included in our sample. This means we can calculate a simple, unweighted average of the measured heights without any correction factors.

This is precisely the approach of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Instead of generating independent random samples with uniform probability, we create a "chain" of samples where each new sample is generated based on the current one. The chain is designed to visit states with frequency proportional to their probability in the target distribution—in our case, the Boltzmann distribution.

When our sampling frequency matches the Boltzmann distribution, we can calculate thermodynamic properties using simple averaging:

$$
\langle A \rangle \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N A(\mathbf{r}_i)
$$

Where configurations $\mathbf{r}_i$ are selected with frequency proportional to $\exp(-U(\mathbf{r}_i)/kT)$.

The challenge now becomes designing a sampling process that naturally visits configurations with frequencies matching their Boltzmann probabilities, without requiring prior knowledge of the full energy landscape. This is where the mathematics of Markov chains provides the solution.

## What is a Markov Chain? {#markov-chain}

The tool we need for sampling according to the Boltzmann distribution is called a "Markov chain."
At its core, a Markov chain is a sequence of states where each new state emerges from the current one through a probabilistic process. For a simple example, consider a weather model where tomorrow's weather depends only on today's weather: if it's sunny today, there might be a 70% chance of sun tomorrow and 30% chance of rain; if it's raining today, there might be a 60% chance of continued rain and 40% chance of sun tomorrow.

The defining characteristic of a Markov chain is its "memoryless" property—the next state depends only on the current state, not on the history of previous states. In our weather example, this means that if it's sunny today, the probability of sun tomorrow is 70% regardless of whether yesterday was sunny or rainy. This property is particularly useful for our sampling problem because it allows us to design a step-by-step process that explores configuration space efficiently without needing to track the entire history of the simulation.

Mathematically, for systems with discrete states, we describe a Markov chain through transition probabilities—the chances of moving from one state to another in a single step. These probabilities form a transition matrix where each entry $P(i\to j)$ represents the probability of moving from state $i$ to state $j$. For our simple weather example, we could represent these as:

```
                  Today
                  Sunny  Rainy
Tomorrow  Sunny   0.7    0.4
          Rainy   0.3    0.6
```

This transition matrix follows what mathematicians call the "column-stochastic" convention. Each column corresponds to a particular starting state, and the entries within that column tell us the probabilities of transitioning to each possible next state. Since these transitions represent all possibilities, the probabilities in each column must sum to 1.^[For students interested in the mathematical perspective: in the column-stochastic convention, we can represent the state of the system as a probability vector $p$ where each entry gives the probability of being in a particular state. If $p_\mathrm{current}$ is the current state distribution, then $p_\mathrm{new} = P\cdot p_\mathrm{current}$ gives the probability distribution after one step of the Markov chain, using standard matrix-vector multiplication. Transition matrices can alternatively be represented in row-stochastic form, where each row (rather than column) sums to 1 and represents the probability distribution of transitions from a particular state. In that case, state vectors are row vectors and matrix operations are performed as $p_\mathrm{new} = p_\mathrm{current}\cdot P$.]

For systems with many possible states, such as molecular configurations, these transition probabilities dictate how the simulation moves through configuration space.

Markov chains that are irreducible (can reach any state from any other state) and aperiodic (don't cycle deterministically) eventually reach an equilibrium distribution. At equilibrium, the probability of finding the system in each state stabilizes to a constant value, even as the system continues to move between states. This stable probability distribution is called the "stationary distribution" of the chain.^[From a mathematical perspective, the stationary distribution $\pi$ of a Markov chain is a probability distribution that remains unchanged after application of the transition matrix. In the column-stochastic convention, this means $\pi = P\cdot\pi$, which is an eigenvalue equation of the form $Ax = \lambda x$ where $\lambda = 1$. In other words, the stationary distribution is the eigenvector of the transition matrix $P$ corresponding to the eigenvalue 1.]

For our sampling purpose, we need to design a Markov chain whose stationary distribution matches exactly the Boltzmann distribution. If we achieve this, then after running the chain for sufficient steps, the frequency with which we visit each configuration will naturally match its Boltzmann probability—solving our sampling problem.

## Summary and Preview

In this lecture, we've introduced the concept of non-uniform sampling for chemical systems and identified why uniform sampling is inefficient for these applications. We've explored how the Boltzmann distribution governs the probability of states in chemical systems at equilibrium, and we've seen how this creates a challenge for computational sampling.

The key concepts we've covered include:

- The fundamental inefficiency of uniform sampling for chemical systems
- The Boltzmann distribution and the exponential relationship between energy and probability
- The importance of focusing our sampling on low-energy regions of configuration space
- The concept of Markov Chain Monte Carlo as a solution to our sampling problem
- The basic properties and mathematics of Markov chains

We've developed an intuitive understanding of Markov chain sampling using the analogy of a random walker traveling through the UK to measure heights, showing how properly constructed random walks can efficiently sample from complex distributions.

In the next lecture, we'll build on this foundation to explore the specific mathematical conditions required for a Markov chain to sample from the Boltzmann distribution. We'll introduce the principle of detailed balance and show how the Metropolis algorithm provides a practical implementation that allows efficient sampling of chemical systems. This will lead us to a complete algorithm for Metropolis Monte Carlo that can be applied to a wide range of systems in computational chemistry.
