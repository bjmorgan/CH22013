Macroscopic properties such as pressure, temperature, and heat capacity emerge from the collective behavior of approximately \\(10^{23}\\) atoms or molecules. These observable quantities represent averages over an immense number of microscopic states. A central challenge in computational chemistry is how to accurately estimate these macroscopic properties without having to evaluate every possible molecular arrangement. 1.1.1 The Statistical Nature of Chemical Systems When we measure properties of chemical systems in the laboratory, we observe the average behavior of countless molecules over the duration of our measurement. Even the simplest systems—gases, liquids, or solids—involve enormous numbers of possible arrangements of atoms, with molecules constantly moving, rotating, and vibrating at finite temperatures. To accurately predict these macroscopic measurements, we need to account for this diversity of molecular configurations. Ideally, we would calculate our property of interest for every possible configuration, weight each result by the probability of that configuration occurring, and then sum these weighted values. The mathematical expression for this average is: \\[\\begin{equation} \\langle A \\rangle = \\sum A(\\mathbf{r}) \\times P(\\mathbf{r}) \\end{equation}\\] Where \\(\\mathbf{r}\\) represents a particular configuration of the system, and \\(P(\\mathbf{r})\\) is the probability of finding the system in that configuration. 1.1.2 Probability Distributions \\(P(\\mathbf{r})\\) represents a probability distribution, which describes the likelihood of finding the system in each possible configuration. Probability distributions form the mathematical foundation for describing systems with inherent variability. Probability distributions come in two forms: Discrete distributions apply when a variable can only take specific, countable values. For these, we use a probability mass function (PMF) that gives the probability of each possible outcome. For example, when rolling a fair six-sided die, each number (1—6) has a probability of 1/6. Another example is counting heads in four coin flips, which follows a binomial distribution where the probability of \\(k\\) heads is \\(\\binom{4}{k} \\times (1/2)^4\\). Continuous distributions apply when a variable can take any value within a continuous range. These use a probability density function (PDF) where the probability of finding the variable in a specific range equals the area under the PDF curve over that range. A simple example is a random point selected along a line segment from 0 to 1, which follows a uniform continuous distribution with constant probability density. In all probability distributions, the total probability must equal 1, meaning the system must exist in some state. The average (expected value) of any property A is calculated by weighting each possible value by its probability and summing over all possibilities—exactly the formula we saw earlier for chemical systems. 1.1.3 The Boltzmann Distribution In chemical systems, the probability distribution that governs molecular configurations is the Boltzmann distribution: \\[\\begin{equation} P(\\mathbf{r}) \\propto \\exp(-U(\\mathbf{r})/kT) \\end{equation}\\] Here, \\(U(\\mathbf{r})\\) is the potential energy of configuration \\(\\mathbf{r}\\), \\(k\\) is Boltzmann’s constant, and \\(T\\) is the temperature. This relationship reveals a fundamental principle in physical chemistry: lower-energy configurations are exponentially more probable than higher-energy ones. At room temperature (298 K), a configuration that is just 6 kJ/mol higher in energy is approximately 10 times less probable than the minimum energy state. Temperature determines how strongly the system favors low-energy states—at high temperatures, the distribution becomes more uniform, while at low temperatures, the system is increasingly restricted to the lowest energy states. To create a valid probability distribution, the probabilities must sum to 1: \\[\\begin{equation} \\sum_i P(\\mathbf{r}) = 1 \\end{equation}\\] We achieve this by including a normalization constant, \\(Z\\): \\[\\begin{equation} P(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{\\exp(-U(\\mathbf{r})/kT)}{Z} \\end{equation}\\] This constant \\(Z\\) is called the “partition function,” defined as: \\[\\begin{equation} Z = \\sum \\exp(-U(\\mathbf{r})/kT) \\end{equation}\\] The partition function plays a central role in statistical mechanics and thermodynamics, connecting microscopic configurations to macroscopic properties. 1.1.4 The Computational Challenge Let’s revisit our fundamental problem. To calculate the thermodynamic average of a property A, we need to evaluate: \\[\\begin{equation} \\langle A \\rangle = \\sum A(\\mathbf{r}) \\times P(\\mathbf{r}) \\end{equation}\\] Where \\(P(\\mathbf{r})\\) is the Boltzmann distribution: \\[\\begin{equation} P(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{\\exp(-U(\\mathbf{r})/kT)}{Z} \\end{equation}\\] A direct approach to this calculation would require: 1. Generating all possible configurations of our system 2. Computing the property A and energy for each configuration 3. Calculating the weighted sum The obstacle lies in the sheer number of possible configurations for any realistic chemical system. Consider a simple example: a \\(10 \\times 10\\) array of surface sites where we want to model the adsorption of 50 molecules. This system has approximately \\(10^{29}\\) possible configurations—more than the number of stars in the observable universe. Direct enumeration becomes impossible. For most chemical systems, the situation is even more extreme. A small protein in solution might have millions of relevant conformations. A metal catalyst with multiple reaction pathways or a polymer chain sampling different spatial arrangements presents an effectively infinite configuration space. This combinatorial explosion makes direct evaluation computationally intractable—even the most powerful supercomputers cannot handle such calculations. 1.2 The Solution: Statistical Sampling Rather than calculating the exact sum, which we’ve established is computationally intractable, we can estimate it through sampling—selecting a subset of configurations that represent the full distribution, evaluating our property of interest for these samples, and calculating their average. This concept of sampling is fundamental throughout science and statistics. Consider estimating the average height of people in Britain. Measuring everyone’s height is impractical, but we can measure a representative sample and use that sample’s average as an estimate of the true population average. The key requirement is that our sample must be representative—it should reflect the true probability distribution of the property we’re measuring. For instance, sampling players arriving for a basketball tournament would likely produce a significant overestimate of the average British height, as basketball players tend to be taller than the general population. In contrast, measuring the heights of people passing by on a street corner on a Saturday afternoon would provide a more representative sample of the British population. When we sample directly from the correct probability distribution (for example, by randomly selecting British citizens with equal probability), we can use simple averaging without additional weighting factors. However, if our sampling method is biased (like measuring only basketball players), we would need to apply appropriate weighting corrections. This principle applies to chemical systems as well. If we could generate configurations directly according to the Boltzmann distribution, calculating thermodynamic properties would simply require averaging the property values: \\[\\begin{equation} \\langle A \\rangle \\approx \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} A(\\mathbf{r}_i) \\end{equation}\\] Where the configurations \\(\\mathbf{r}_i\\) are selected with probability proportional to \\(\\exp(-U(\\mathbf{r}_i)/kT)\\). 1.3 Two Approaches to Sampling Two principal methods have been developed to address the sampling challenge in computational chemistry: 1.3.1 Molecular Dynamics Approach Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulates atomic motion according to Newton’s laws. By following these physical trajectories, MD can sample configurations according to their Boltzmann probabilities. When a simulation trajectory visits a suitably representative set of configurations in the relevant regions of configuration space, the time average provides a good approximation of the desired ensemble average: \\[\\begin{equation} \\langle A \\rangle \\approx \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{i=1}^{M} A(\\mathbf{r}_i) \\end{equation}\\] Where \\(M\\) is the number of time steps. However, the effectiveness of MD sampling depends on the system’s energy landscape. Consider a protein folding example: if high energy barriers separate different conformational states, the protein may remain trapped in one conformation for the entire simulation duration. The resulting time average would reflect only a small subset of the relevant configuration space, not the true equilibrium ensemble. Timescales present another challenge. Many important chemical processes occur on microsecond to second timescales, while individual MD time steps typically represent femtoseconds. This creates a fundamental gap between simulation capability and the time needed to observe certain phenomena. For instance, studying a slow conformational change or a rare reaction event may require prohibitively long simulation times. Additionally, some systems inherently resist treatment via continuous dynamics. Lattice models with discrete site occupancies, magnetic materials with fixed spin orientations, or any problem where variables can only take discrete values often require different sampling approaches altogether. 1.3.2 Monte Carlo Approach Monte Carlo (MC) methods, named after the famous casino district in Monaco, use random numbers to estimate complex averages through sampling. This approach offers a powerful alternative to Molecular Dynamics for calculating equilibrium properties. In its simplest form, Monte Carlo sampling involves generating configurations using random numbers, evaluating the property of interest for each configuration, and computing the average of these values. 1.4 Fundamental Monte Carlo Examples Before addressing the sampling challenges in chemical systems, let’s examine two classic examples that illustrate the power of Monte Carlo methods with uniform sampling. These examples demonstrate the core principles using simple problems where each possible outcome has an equal probability of occurring. 1.4.1 Estimating π by Monte Carlo Integration One of the simplest demonstrations of Monte Carlo methods is estimating the value of \\(\\pi\\). Consider a circle with radius 1 inscribed inside a square with side length 2. The area of the circle is \\(\\pi\\), while the area of the square is 4. Therefore, the ratio of these areas is \\(\\pi/4\\). We can estimate this ratio by randomly placing points within the square and counting what fraction fall inside the circle. The procedure involves generating \\(N\\) random points with coordinates \\((x,y)\\), where \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are uniformly distributed between −1 and 1. We then count how many points \\(M\\) satisfy \\(x^2 + y^2 \\leq 1\\), which indicates they fall within the circle. The estimate for \\(\\pi\\) is given by: \\(\\pi \\approx 4 \\times M/N\\). This approach demonstrates how random sampling can solve a deterministic problem. 1.4.2 Function Averaging and Numerical Integration Our second example involves calculating the average value of a function over a specific interval. Consider finding the average value of \\(\\sin^2(x)\\) over the interval \\([0,\\pi]\\). Mathematically, this average is defined as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\text{Average value} = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\times \\int_0^{\\pi} \\sin^2(x) dx \\end{equation}\\] The analytical solution to this integral is 1/2. Using Monte Carlo methods, we can estimate this average by generating uniform random \\(x\\)-values between 0 and \\(\\pi\\), calculating \\(\\sin^2(x)\\) for each point, and then averaging these results. This procedure can be generalized to estimate any definite integral: \\[\\begin{equation} \\int_a^b f(x) dx \\approx (b-a) \\times \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} f(x_i) \\end{equation}\\] Where \\(x_1\\), \\(x_2\\), …, \\(x_n\\) are uniform random numbers between \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). The strength of this approach becomes apparent when dealing with multi-dimensional integrals, where traditional numerical methods become exponentially more expensive as dimensionality increases. 1.5 Statistical Uncertainty in Monte Carlo Methods A fundamental characteristic of all Monte Carlo methods is that they produce estimates rather than exact answers. Each time we run a Monte Carlo simulation with a different sequence of random numbers, we get a slightly different result. This variation is the source of statistical uncertainty in Monte Carlo methods. Unlike deterministic methods, which might have errors from approximations but give the same answer every time, Monte Carlo methods produce different answers on different runs. This inherent variability means we must consider Monte Carlo results as estimates with associated uncertainty. The precision of these estimates improves as we increase the number of samples. Statistical uncertainty decreases proportionally to \\(1/\\sqrt{N}\\), where \\(N\\) is the number of random samples. To reduce the uncertainty by half, we need to use four times as many samples. This scaling behavior is characteristic of random sampling methods and remains independent of the dimensionality of the problem—a significant advantage in high-dimensional applications. When reporting results from Monte Carlo simulations, it is essential to always include the associated uncertainties alongside the estimated values. This practice is a fundamental aspect of scientific reporting in computational chemistry and allows others to properly evaluate the reliability of the results. 1.6 Summary and Preview 1.6.1 Key Takeaways from Lecture 1 Monte Carlo methods provide powerful tools for estimating averages in complex systems through statistical sampling. We’ve explored: The basic principles of random sampling How Monte Carlo techniques can be applied to mathematical problems The inherent statistical uncertainty in Monte Carlo results and how it decreases with sample size The examples in this lecture have all used uniform sampling—where each possible outcome has an equal probability of being selected. This approach works well for many mathematical problems, including certain numerical integration tasks and geometrical probability calculations. 1.6.2 Looking Ahead to Lecture 2 In the next lecture, we’ll extend Monte Carlo methods to chemical systems, which present additional challenges. We’ll explore how to sample molecular configurations according to the Boltzmann distribution introduced earlier, allowing us to calculate thermodynamic properties of realistic chemical systems. The Metropolis algorithm will provide a solution to the challenge of sampling from the Boltzmann distribution without knowing the partition function. This method has become a cornerstone in computational chemistry, enabling Monte Carlo simulations across a wide range of applications.

In the first lecture, we focussed on the problem of calculating some property \\(A\\) as an average over a large set of states. Recall from the first lecture that for any property A, its true average value is calculated as a sum over all possible states: \\[ \\langle A \\rangle = \\sum_i A_i \\times P_i \\] Where \\(A_i\\) is the value of property A in state \\(i\\), and \\(P_i\\) is the probability of state \\(i\\) occurring. In many problems of this type, evaluating this sum exactly is impossible due to the existence of an enormous number of states. Monte Carlo methods allow us to estimate \\(\\langle A \\rangle\\) by sampling a subset of randomly chosen states. In the examples in Lecture 1, we used uniform sampling—where each possible location in our sample space has an equal probability of being selected. In these examples, uniform sampling was effective because it allowed us to efficiently explore the regions of sample space relevant to the property we were estimating. For chemical systems at equilibrium, however, uniform sampling is highly inefficient, frequently to the extent of being computationally intractable, and we instead use non-uniform sampling to more efficiently estimate \\(\\langle A \\rangle\\). 2.2 Boltzmann Sampling and the Inefficiency of Uniform Sampling For chemical systems at equilibrium, states are distributed according to the Boltzmann distribution: \\[ P(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{\\exp(-U(\\mathbf{r})/kT)}{Z} \\] Where the partition function \\(Z\\) is: \\[ Z = \\sum \\exp(-U(\\mathbf{r})/kT) \\] If we were to sample uniformly, we might initially propose estimating \\(\\langle A \\rangle\\) via: \\[ \\langle A \\rangle \\approx \\frac{1}{Z} \\sum_{i=1}^N A(r_i) \\exp(-U(r_i)/kT) \\] However, this approach requires knowing \\(Z\\), which we typically cannot compute directly as it involves summing over all possible states—the very challenge we’re using Monte Carlo to overcome. Fortunately, we can construct an alternative estimator that doesn’t require prior knowledge of \\(Z\\): \\[ \\langle A \\rangle \\approx \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^N A(r_i) \\exp(-U(r_i)/kT)}{\\sum_{i=1}^N \\exp(-U(r_i)/kT)} \\] The denominator effectively estimates \\(Z\\) from our samples, allowing us to compute averages without knowing \\(Z\\) in advance. Even with this improved estimator, uniform sampling remains highly inefficient for chemical systems. The Boltzmann factor decreases exponentially as energy increases, meaning any property \\(\\langle A \\rangle\\) is dominated by contributions from a relatively small number of low-energy states. The vast majority of possible states have high energies with negligible Boltzmann weights, yet these states occupy most of the configuration space. Consider a molecular system with \\(N\\) atoms (\\(3N\\) spatial degrees of freedom). In a system with just 10 atoms, uniform sampling would predominantly generate configurations with atoms positioned unphysically close to each other. These high-energy configurations have effectively zero Boltzmann weights, contributing nothing to our estimate of \\(\\langle A \\rangle\\). However, uniform sampling spends nearly all of its time generating these irrelevant states, resulting in extremely slow convergence. This inefficiency worsens exponentially with system size. Each additional degree of freedom further reduces the already tiny fraction of configuration space containing physically relevant states. For most chemical systems of interest, uniform sampling becomes computationally unfeasible. We need an alternative approach—a method that preferentially samples the low-energy regions that dominate the Boltzmann distribution. This is the central focus of this lecture. 2.3 The Solution: Markov Chain Monte Carlo In Lecture 1, we discussed estimating the average height of people in Britain by measuring a representative sample. Let’s revisit this example to illustrate the challenge of sampling from a complex distribution. If we attempted uniform geographical sampling—randomly selecting 100m × 100m squares on a map of Britain and measuring everyone within each selected square—we would encounter severe inefficiency. Most selected squares would contain few or no people (falling on rural areas, forests, mountains, or bodies of water), while densely populated urban areas would be underrepresented. We would waste most of our sampling effort on empty regions while gathering insufficient data from cities and towns, where the majority of people live. This mirrors our problem in chemical systems: uniform sampling of configuration space predominantly generates high-energy states with negligible Boltzmann weights, while the physically relevant low-energy states occupy only a tiny fraction of the total space. A more efficient approach to our height-measuring problem would be to design a sampling process that naturally visits locations with frequency proportional to their population density. Imagine a “random walker” traversing the UK, who: Spends most time in cities and towns Occasionally visits villages and small settlements Rarely ventures into uninhabited areas This walker would measure the height of individuals encountered during the journey. The crucial insight is that if our walker visits each location with probability exactly proportional to the number of people there, then each person in the UK has an equal chance of being included in our sample. This means we can calculate a simple, unweighted average of the measured heights without any correction factors. This is precisely the approach of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Instead of generating independent random samples with uniform probability, we create a “chain” of samples where each new sample is generated based on the current one. The chain is designed to visit states with frequency proportional to their probability in the target distribution—in our case, the Boltzmann distribution. When our sampling frequency matches the Boltzmann distribution, we can calculate thermodynamic properties using simple averaging: \\[ \\langle A \\rangle \\approx \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N A(\\mathbf{r}_i) \\] Where configurations \\(\\mathbf{r}_i\\) are selected with frequency proportional to \\(\\exp(-U(\\mathbf{r}_i)/kT)\\). The challenge now becomes designing a sampling process that naturally visits configurations with frequencies matching their Boltzmann probabilities, without requiring prior knowledge of the full energy landscape. This is where the mathematics of Markov chains provides the solution. 2.4 What is a Markov Chain? The tool we need for sampling according to the Boltzmann distribution is called a “Markov chain.” At its core, a Markov chain is a sequence of states where each new state emerges from the current one through a probabilistic process. For a simple example, consider a weather model where tomorrow’s weather depends only on today’s weather: if it’s sunny today, there might be a 70% chance of sun tomorrow and 30% chance of rain; if it’s raining today, there might be a 60% chance of continued rain and 40% chance of sun tomorrow. The defining characteristic of a Markov chain is its “memoryless” property—the next state depends only on the current state, not on the history of previous states. In our weather example, this means that if it’s sunny today, the probability of sun tomorrow is 70% regardless of whether yesterday was sunny or rainy. This property is particularly useful for our sampling problem because it allows us to design a step-by-step process that explores configuration space efficiently without needing to track the entire history of the simulation. Mathematically, for systems with discrete states, we describe a Markov chain through transition probabilities—the chances of moving from one state to another in a single step. These probabilities form a transition matrix where each entry \\(P(i\\to j)\\) represents the probability of moving from state \\(i\\) to state \\(j\\). For our simple weather example, we could represent these as: Today Sunny Rainy Tomorrow Sunny 0.7 0.4 Rainy 0.3 0.6 This transition matrix follows what mathematicians call the “column-stochastic” convention. Each column corresponds to a particular starting state, and the entries within that column tell us the probabilities of transitioning to each possible next state. Since these transitions represent all possibilities, the probabilities in each column must sum to 1.1 For systems with many possible states, such as molecular configurations, these transition probabilities dictate how the simulation moves through configuration space. Markov chains that are irreducible (can reach any state from any other state) and aperiodic (don’t cycle deterministically) eventually reach an equilibrium distribution. At equilibrium, the probability of finding the system in each state stabilizes to a constant value, even as the system continues to move between states. This stable probability distribution is called the “stationary distribution” of the chain.2 For our sampling purpose, we need to design a Markov chain whose stationary distribution matches exactly the Boltzmann distribution. If we achieve this, then after running the chain for sufficient steps, the frequency with which we visit each configuration will naturally match its Boltzmann probability—solving our sampling problem. 2.5 Summary and Preview In this lecture, we’ve introduced the concept of non-uniform sampling for chemical systems and identified why uniform sampling is inefficient for these applications. We’ve explored how the Boltzmann distribution governs the probability of states in chemical systems at equilibrium, and we’ve seen how this creates a challenge for computational sampling. The key concepts we’ve covered include: The fundamental inefficiency of uniform sampling for chemical systems The Boltzmann distribution and the exponential relationship between energy and probability The importance of focusing our sampling on low-energy regions of configuration space The concept of Markov Chain Monte Carlo as a solution to our sampling problem The basic properties and mathematics of Markov chains We’ve developed an intuitive understanding of Markov chain sampling using the analogy of a random walker traveling through the UK to measure heights, showing how properly constructed random walks can efficiently sample from complex distributions. In the next lecture, we’ll build on this foundation to explore the specific mathematical conditions required for a Markov chain to sample from the Boltzmann distribution. We’ll introduce the principle of detailed balance and show how the Metropolis algorithm provides a practical implementation that allows efficient sampling of chemical systems. This will lead us to a complete algorithm for Metropolis Monte Carlo that can be applied to a wide range of systems in computational chemistry. For students interested in the mathematical perspective: in the column-stochastic convention, we can represent the state of the system as a probability vector \\(p\\) where each entry gives the probability of being in a particular state. If \\(p_\\mathrm{current}\\) is the current state distribution, then \\(p_\\mathrm{new} = P\\cdot p_\\mathrm{current}\\) gives the probability distribution after one step of the Markov chain, using standard matrix-vector multiplication. Transition matrices can alternatively be represented in row-stochastic form, where each row (rather than column) sums to 1 and represents the probability distribution of transitions from a particular state. In that case, state vectors are row vectors and matrix operations are performed as \\(p_\\mathrm{new} = p_\\mathrm{current}\\cdot P\\).↩︎ From a mathematical perspective, the stationary distribution \\(\\pi\\) of a Markov chain is a probability distribution that remains unchanged after application of the transition matrix. In the column-stochastic convention, this means \\(\\pi = P\\cdot\\pi\\), which is an eigenvalue equation of the form \\(Ax = \\lambda x\\) where \\(\\lambda = 1\\). In other words, the stationary distribution is the eigenvector of the transition matrix \\(P\\) corresponding to the eigenvalue 1.↩︎ "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
