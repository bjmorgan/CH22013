## Derivation of Exponential Waiting Times

Let us consider a memoryless process with rate constant $k$. The probability of the event occurring in an infinitesimally small time interval $\mathrm{d}t$ is given by:

$$P(\mathrm{d}t) = k \times \mathrm{d}t$$

To derive the distribution of waiting times, we first consider the probability of survival $S(t)$&mdash;the probability that the event has not occurred by time $t$. Because at any point in time our process has either occurred or survived, $P(t) + S(t) = 1$, where $P(t)$ is the probability that the event has occurred by time $t$.

Let us imagine we already know the probability of survival at time $t$, and we want to calculate the probability of continued survival at some later time $t+\mathrm{d}t$. This is given by the probability of survival at time $t$, multiplied by the probability of survival for the following time interval $\mathrm{d}t$:

$$
S(t+\mathrm{d}t) = S(t) \times S(\mathrm{d}t)
$$

Because $P(t) + S(t) = 1$ for any time $t$, 

$$S(\mathrm{d}t) = 1 - P(\mathrm{d}t) = 1 -k\,\mathrm{d}t,$$

and 

\begin{eqnarray}
S(t+\mathrm{d}t) & = S(t) (1 - k\,\mathrm{d}t) \\
                 & = S(t) - k S(t) \mathrm{d}t
\end{eqnarray}

Rearranging:

$$
S(t+\mathrm{d} t) - S(t) = -k S(t)\,\mathrm{d}t
$$

or

$$
\frac{S(t+\mathrm{d}t) - S(t)}{\mathrm{d}t} = -k S(t)
$$

In the limit that $\mathrm{d}t$ becomes infinitesimally small, this becomes a differential equation that describes the instantaneous rate of change of the survival probability with time:

$$
\frac{\mathrm{d}S(t)}{\mathrm{d}t} = -k S(t)
$$

Integrating from $t=0$ to $t=t$, with the initial condition $S(0) = 1$ (we are certain the event has not occurred when $t=0$), gives the probability that the event has not occurred by time $t$:

$$S(t) = \exp(-kt)$$

As $t$ increases, the probability that the event has not occurred by this time decreases according to a negative exponential.

From this, the probability that the event has occurred in time $t$ is:
$$
P(t) = 1 - \exp(-kt)
$$

This is the cumulative probability function (CDF). It describes the probability that the event occurs at some time less than or equal to $t$.
If we want the probability density function (PDF) for the event occurring at exactly time $t$, then we differentiate this function:

$$
p_\mathrm{wait}(t) = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(1-\exp(-kt)) = k\exp(-kt)
$$

This result tells us that the probability density function of waiting times is the exponential distribution with parameter $k$, confirming our earlier statement.

## Derivation of Event Selection Probabilities

Consider two competing events with rate constants $k_1$ and $k_2$. We want to find the probability that event 1 happens first. This equals the probability that event 1 occurs at some time $t$ AND event 2 hasn't occurred by that time, integrated over all possible times $t$:

\begin{eqnarray}
P(\text{Event 1 occurs first}) &=& \int_0^{\infty} P(\text{Event 1 occurs at time }t) \times P(\text{Event 2 hasn't occurred by time }t) \, \mathrm{d}t \\
&=& \int_0^{\infty} k_1 \exp(-k_1 t) \times \exp(-k_2 t) \, \mathrm{d}t \\
&=& k_1 \int_0^{\infty} \exp(-(k_1 + k_2)t) \, \mathrm{d}t \\
&=& k_1 \times \frac{1}{k_1 + k_2} \\
&=& \frac{k_1}{k_1 + k_2}
\end{eqnarray}

Similarly, for event 2:

\begin{eqnarray}
P(\text{Event 2 occurs first}) &=& \int_0^{\infty} P(\text{Event 2 occurs at time }t) \times P(\text{Event 1 hasn't occurred by time }t) \, \mathrm{d}t \\
&=& \int_0^{\infty} k_2 \exp(-k_2 t) \times \exp(-k_1 t) \, \mathrm{d}t \\
&=& k_2 \int_0^{\infty} \exp(-(k_1 + k_2)t) \, \mathrm{d}t \\
&=& k_2 \times \frac{1}{k_1 + k_2} \\
&=& \frac{k_2}{k_1 + k_2}
\end{eqnarray}

This confirms our earlier result that the probability of a particular event being the first to occur is proportional to its rate constant divided by the sum of all rate constants.

The same approach generalizes to any number of competing events. For $N$ events with rate constants $k_1, k_2, ..., k_N$, the probability that event $j$ occurs first is:

$$P(\text{Event j occurs first}) = \frac{k_j}{\sum_{i=1}^{N} k_i}$$

This result forms the basis for event selection in the KMC algorithm, where we use a random number to select events with probabilities proportional to their rates.
